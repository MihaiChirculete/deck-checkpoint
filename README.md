# Deck-Checkpoint
This is a save syncronization utility that aims to make it easy to sync saves between your steam deck and other devices.
Since some games on steam do not support cloud saves you need to manually transfer save games from
your deck to other devices. This tool takes care of that for you automatically!

# Disclaimer
Use this tool at your own risk. This tool is under development and functionality may be missing or broken.
Always create backups of your saves to prevent loss of data.
